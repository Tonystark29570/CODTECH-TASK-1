###OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

###PROJECT: MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISION

###OBJECTIVE

*A sample table with evaluation metrics.
*Code implementation in Python using scikit-learn.
*Report summarizing the evaluation and comparison.

1. Sample Table
Hereâ€™s a table comparing Logistic Regression and Random Forest based on a hypothetical binary classification task:


Model       	      Accuracy	      Precision	     Recall	     F1 Score	     ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	89%	            85%	           87%	       86%	         90%
Random Forest	      94%	            92%	           91%	       91.5%	       95%

2. Code Implementation
