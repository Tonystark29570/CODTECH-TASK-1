   3. Report
   Model Evaluation and Comparison Report
   *Introduction
    The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, for a binary classification problem. The dataset includes 1,000 
    samples and 20 features, and the objective is to predict the target class effectively.

    *Dataset Description
     The dataset consists of:

     *Features: 20 numerical features.
      Samples: 1,000 instances, split into training (80%) and testing (20%).
      Target Variable: Binary class (0 or 1).
      Models Evaluated

      Logistic Regression: A linear model widely used for binary classification.
      Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
      Evaluation Metrics
      The models were evaluated based on:

      Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted instances.
      Precision: Ratio of true positives to predicted positives.
      Recall: Ability to identify all relevant instances.
      F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
      ROC-AUC: Area under the ROC curve, measuring overall performance.
      Results

      Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score	ROC-AUC
      Logistic Regression	89%	85%	87%	86%	90%
      Random Forest	94%	92%	91%	91.5%	95%
      Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression across all metrics, with a notable improvement in accuracy (+5%) and ROC-AUC (+5%).

      Conclusion
      Based on the evaluation, Random Forest is the preferred model for this binary classification task due to its higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It demonstrates 
      better generalization and robustness compared to Logistic Regression.
